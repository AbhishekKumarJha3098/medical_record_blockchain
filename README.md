## Introduction
Managing Patient documents across different Hospital is quite hassling. This Dapp, Hospital Blockchain Records helps in maintaining Patient's Medical history. 
Only Hospital authority has the priviledge to upload  Medical documents for the patients registered in our system. For storing the files, we have used IPFS, which
is a peer-to-peer distributed system.

## Technology Stack
1) Ethereum Blockchain
2) Solidity
3) Web3 JS
4) IPFS
5) Metamask Wallet
6) React JS

## Features
1) Decentralized Database for all reports of patients which can be easily accessible by all the hospitals.
2) As we are storing the Records in blockchain and IPFS it will be untampered by any entity.
3) No need to provide any proof of authenticity, as the records are in blockchain.
